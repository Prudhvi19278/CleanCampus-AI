        <h2>AI Solution Overview</h2>
        <p>
            CleanCampus AI is a conceptual AI-based system that allows users to report
            cleanliness issues on campus. The system uses AI concepts to analyze
            reported issues, categorize waste types, assign priority levels, and
            support campus authorities in maintaining hygiene and sustainability.
