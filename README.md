# CleanCampus AI

CleanCampus AI is a conceptual AI-based campus cleanliness monitoring project
developed for the 1M1B AI for Sustainability Virtual Internship.

## Problem
University campuses face cleanliness and hygiene issues due to improper waste
disposal, lack of monitoring, and delayed action.

## Solution
The project proposes an AI-based approach where users can report cleanliness
issues, AI categorizes them, assigns priority, and supports campus authorities
in taking timely action.

## SDG Alignment
- SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

## Note
This is a prototype-level and conceptual project.
No real AI model or software implementation has been deployed.
